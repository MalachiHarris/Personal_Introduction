    <h1>Personal Introduction of Malachi Harris</h1>
    
    <h2>1) Favorite culture that you are not native to?</h2><br>
    <ul>My favorite culture that I'm not native to is India's. Their values are very different than that of my own, being more content with less, more comunal and having a high regard of close family ties. </ul><br>
    <h2>2) Two or more historical figures that you relate to?</h2><br>
    <ul>One historical figure that I relate to is Morgan Freeman in that he had to try for many years before he found success later in life<br>
    Another figure that I relate to is Carla Ruekart, having a very grounded and faithful approach to serving the purpose that she felt called to in life.</ul><br>
    <h2>3) A meal that represents you?</h2><br>
    <ul>A meal that I feel represents me would be a plate of rice topped with over easy eggs w/ cheese and mixed vegetables. It's has everything that one needs :) </ul><br>
    <h2>4) Finish the sentence: "I feel most creative when I ....": </h2><br>
    <ul>I feel most creative when I give myself space to both fully try as well as leave and come back to my work. </ul>
