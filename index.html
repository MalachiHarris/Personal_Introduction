    <h1>Personal Introduction of Malachi Harris</h1>
    
    1) Favorite culture that you are not native to, <br>
    My favorite cultur that I'm not native to is India's. Their values are very different than that of my own, being more content with less, more comunal and high regard of close family ties. <br>
    2) Two or more historical figures that you relate to <br>
    One historical figure that I relate to is Morgan Freeman in that he had to try for many years before he found success later in life<br>
    Another figure that I relate to is Carla Ruekart, having a very grounded and faithful approach to serving the purpose that she felt called to in life.<br>
    3) A meal that represents you <br>
    A meal that I feel represents me would be a plate of rice topped with over easy eggs w/ cheese and mixed vegetables. It's has everything that one needs :) <br>
    4) Finish the sentence: "I feel most creative when I ...." <br>
    I feel most creative when I give myself space to come back to the work.
